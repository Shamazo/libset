#Libset
##A basic set library written in c.
This is a implementation of sets using red-black trees. The complexity of various operations is described in the following table.

| Operation | Complexity|
| ----------|-----------|
|Insertion  | O(Log(n))  |
|Deletion 	|  O(Log(n))  |
|set intersection| O(n+m) |
|set union| O(n+m)  |
|set count | O(n)|   |
|set is member| O(log(n))  |
